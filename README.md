I’m thrilled to share that I recently had the opportunity to create a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for a leading Boat company.

The dashboard is designed to provide valuable insights into the company’s key performance metrics, helping the team make data-driven decisions with ease. By integrating multiple data sources, I’ve built an interactive and dynamic reporting tool that visualizes trends, performance, and growth areas in real-time.
